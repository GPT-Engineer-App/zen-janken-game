# zen-janken-game

A simple rock-paper-scissors („Åò„ÇÉ„Çì„Åë„Çì) game app. The app should have a clean and intuitive interface, allowing users to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. It should display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the match (win, lose, or draw). Ideally, the app should have a Japanese aesthetic, with minimalistic design elements and a soothing color palette. The game logic will be straightforward, determining the winner based on the classic rules of rock-paper-scissors.
